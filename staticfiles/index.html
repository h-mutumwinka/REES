        <h2>Welcome to the Rural Education Empowerment System (REES)</h2>
        <p>
            A modern digital learning platform designed to empower rural communities 
            by providing accessible, high-quality education. REES brings innovation to 
            places where learning opportunities are limited, bridging the gap between 
            rural challenges and digital possibilities.

    <!-- ABOUT REES -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>What is REES?</h2>
        <p>
            REES is a technology-driven initiative focused on transforming rural education 
            in Africa. Many communities lack access to computers, structured lessons, and 
            digital tools — and we believe every child deserves an opportunity to learn, 
            grow, and dream without limits. Through REES, students, youth, and adults gain 
            access to structured courses, interactive lessons, digital literacy, and 
            essential skills needed to thrive in a fast-changing world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to support lifelong learning by combining modern tools, 
            user-friendly platforms, and community empowerment strategies. REES is more 
            than an app — it is a movement for a brighter future.

        <h2>Our Vision for Rural Communities</h2>
        <p>
            REES envisions a world where every rural child has equal access to digital 
            knowledge. A world where education is not limited by geography, income, or 
            environment. Our goal is to nurture confident learners, innovators, and 
            leaders who will contribute to their communities and shape a better tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe technology can break barriers. With the right tools, even the 
            most remote communities can unlock their full potential.
